This is a simple guideline on running our system, we will enrich the document and open source our code with entire benchmark as soon as possible.

0. Requirements

Python 3.6

Python packages
tensorflow==1.0.0
Jinja2==2.9.5
MarkupSafe==0.23
numpy==1.12.0
protobuf==3.2.0
six==1.10.0
tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0

1. Data

We provide two small datasets of our QA4IE benchmark in the folder "data/".

2. Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing code at prepro_span.py and prepro_seq.py in the folder "code/squad/" to preprocess these two files. You need to make sure the file path are correct in the code.

3. Train

To train our model in default settings, run:

python -m basic.cli --mode train --len_opt --cluster --run_id QA4IE

You may need to fix the problem on file path. Additional settings can be found in "code/basic/cli.py"

4. Test

To test, run:

python -m basic.cli --run_id QA4IE

5. Evaluate

To evaluate, run:

python squad/evaluate-v1.1.py <file dir of groundtruth> <file dir of test result>
